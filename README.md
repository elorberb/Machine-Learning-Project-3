# Machine-Learning-Project-3
Using unsupervised algorithms for clustering and PCA for dimension reduction.
In this project we used data from Kagel to perform clustering.
We worked with text data that we processed using tfidf to apply the Kmeans algorithm.
We searched for the optimal k for finding the clusters using the elbow method and silhouette method.
To see the data in 2d and 3d we used PCA.
